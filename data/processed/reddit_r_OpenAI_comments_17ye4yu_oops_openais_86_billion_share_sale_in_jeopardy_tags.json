    "I doubt he did something as horrible. Here's why, according to the statements:..OpenAI staff were later told by the chief operating officer, Brad Lightcap, in an internal company memo his sacking was over a \u201cbreakdown in communication between Sam and the board\u201d, and not \u201cmalfeasance or anything related to our financial, business, safety, or security/privacy practices\u201d...Basically it wasn't any of those. Now, while I do consider it is possible there is more, maybe AGI related stuff that Sam hasn't exactly been candid about, my theory is that the earlier candor statement is related to that new venture which he wasn't straightforward about with the board. The board is already talking about whether he should be reinstated since investors demand it, and if they don't, it will probably not go well from them as legal battle. But, this is mainly about Ilya and board wanting non profit and slower pace and Sam pushed for profit and faster pace. I think whatever Altman supposedly did \u201chide\u201d from the board was obviously this new venture for profit, because Ilya according to this wants to protect the non profit, which is why this \u201ccoup\u201d happened in the first place:..Staff reportedly asked OpenAI's chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, a co-founder and board member at OpenAI who leads an AI safety team, whether it amounted to a \u201ccoup\u201d or \u201chostile takeover\u201d by others on the board..\u201cYou can call it this way,\u201d Sutskever responded. \u201cAnd I can understand why you chose this word, but I disagree with this. This was the board doing its duty to the mission of the non-profit, which is to make sure that OpenAI builds AGI [artificial general intelligence] that benefits all of humanity,\u201d he said, according to The Information...The board wants to protect Open AI non profit, safety/ humanity first principles before Altmans more profit driven \u201cinnovation\u201d approach. I can't wait to see how this turns out though, this is straight up real life succession..Sources:.https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-openai-investors-ceo-board-chatgpt-2023-11?amp.https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/18/earthquake-at-chatgpt-developer-as-senior-staff-quit-after-sacking-of-boss-sam-altman",
    "Lol... Yeah, you don't for the CEO over a \"communication breakdown\" you fire them for a major fuck up and call it a communications breakdown.",
    "Yeah, because it is an insane move. I first thought too that it is something serious that he must have done to get fired like that, and this way publicly. But besides the profits, I lots of smaller things could have contributed to it besides that, for example DDOS attack Open AI recently, then after dev day scaling issues, and due that the GPT4 waitlist. The custom GPT store release, which is commercializing the company. The statement clearly implied he hid or lied something from the board, you add up enough things like this and the new venture as well, that was enough for Ilya to convince the board Sam wasn't fit to lead besides the division on for profit or non profit. It makes sense too since firing came out of nowhere for everyone at Open Air except the board and Mira Murati (knew 1 day before)\u2026The fact that investors and microsoft were surprised too is kinda crazy.",
    "idk but the actual sources are all mostly vague about everything  .even the article in the OP is quoting \"sources that are familiar\"  .so idk, but heres communication breakdown",

The other is core to product..I would say product wins..Sam and Greg will find funding to spin up another company quickly, but they won't have Ilya, they won't have the infrastructure, they won't have the brand recognition or partnerships, and they won't have the customer base. They will have a huge amount of catching up to do, and without the AI genius who was leading product development..I will also take everything from Sam about what happened with a grain of salt. We may never know the details, but I think it's likely Sam is walking out of a situation where he had no equity into one where he he has a bunch of equity and attracts a lot of investors. .\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0",

    "until the product is delivered, you definitely want to keep the development team",
    "Both are critical, but AI is like a horse race right now, and the top-end engineering talent are the horses.",
    "As an ai person myself I go with Sam and the people that leave to join him. The company will become impotent with Ilya's vision. What Ilya wants isn't market viable. There are a ton of places to work where your research doesn't make it into the product and openai will just be another one of those. He is trying to block access to gpt's I am assuming. Sees this as AI for everyone and an existential threat to humanity. I don't. He is in the way of progress and also setting back ai ethics, which is super important, by being an arson.",
    "Obviously Ilya is a genius, but intuitively I feel like engineers are easier to find than smart, ethical, charismatic, visionary CEOs who pretty much everyone likes.",
    "100% this .Especially in the tech world, most engineers are deer in the headlights when having to interact with the outside world, which in their case is crucial.",
    "Also Ilya is not an engineer anymore, he is a department head.  At that level he suffers from the Peter principle - no longer doing what he is good at, being an individual contributor, but instead in a role of leader (communication, charisma, consensus building) that he likely is not as skilled at..I mean\u2026convincing the board is impressive, I'll give him that.  But they had no partners on board, even the one paying to keep the lights on (Microsoft), nor any of the rank and file employees.  Now he is basically facing revolt from all sides.",
    "He's also demonstrated himself to be a disloyal backstabber, so regardless of how this shakes out the next CEO was going to fire his ass anyways.",
    "Yup, it is a super bad move. I would not work with him after this. From what I can tell from interviews with Ilya this had to do with rolling out custom gpt's and he fears people having access to ai. Staging a coup off of your basically religious beliefs and being an arson to the entire organization is not cool. The gpt marketplace is huge and this attempt (assuming here but im pretty sure) to block everyone to develop custom gpt's is not cool. It also sets ai ethics back. That is an area that is very important in general and to me personally, but this makes all of it look foolish.",
    "OMG, thoughtful and ethical CEOs are almost impossible to find and create, but so important to have.",
    "They're a myth. \"Apparently ethical\" perhaps.",
    "I agree. There are a lot of super talented AI researchers that would love to work at Sam's new full steam ahead Ai company assuming he would start one. Not saying he is easy to replace, but it is far along enough now people, including many of the super talented researchers at openai, could get very far.",
    "We'll see about that. I don't think Ilya is going to have a lot of options legally speaking. The traitorous 4 will face a lifetime of lawsuits. Do you really think Microsoft, Sequoia and others will accept this and call it a day. I am guessing the board has received some legal advice and will backtrack in the next 48 hours. You don't get billions of dollars from these players to eff around..Look at what happened witj Anthony Lewandoski the guy who was also a \u201cgenius\u201d and tried to steal secrets from Google.  He went to Federal Prison. .Ilya's career is over me thinks. .We'll see what happens. I don't think messing with Microsoft after they give you 13B is a good ideas.",
    "I would be surprised if the board acted without documentation of something substantial that arguably warranted or even necessitated his removal..There's plenty to doubt in the situation at this time, but I don't see why Sam should be the one to receive all the benefit of the doubt on this.",
    "They issued a statement today saying \u201cthere was no malfeasance\u201d. That means there will be a whole lot of lawsuits. There are too many powerful people involved.",
    "\"No malfeasance\" doesn't necessarily indicate that there was no just cause. It could have been unprofessional conduct, conflict of interest, or something else that called his integrity into question but which was not illegal or intentionally harmful. We just need to wait and see what comes of it.",
    "I don't think you understand the power that is vested in the board and what they are legally allowed to do. Whether their actions are wise is a different discussion.. but you don't seem to understand that just because Microsoft invested as much as they did that did not grant them power on the board and they knew that before they made their investment and still chose to invest.",
    "Legally Microsoft could argue the deal was made in bad faith, or the agree is void due to change in strategy, pull funding and OpenAI is bankrupt tomorrow..Technically they have zero control over openAI's non profit side, but in reality they are funding the entire venture and thus have all the soft power.",
    "Please explain how, as a result of Sam's ouster, Microsoft could possibly argue in court that the deal was made in bad faith?.Keep in mind that when Microsoft chose to invest in OAI they did so knowing they would have no power on the board and that the OAI board has the legal authority to make decisions such as this. The board has the power to change leadership and Microsoft legally has no say in that. Whether the board's decision was wise or not is irrelevant. Howyou feel about it is irrelevant. The board is legally allowed to make such mistakes (i.e. they have a right to govern themselves). And Microsoft would absolutely have known this and absolutely would have recognized the corporate structure of OAI as a fundamental part of Microsoft's investment agreement with them..So... Please. Continue and explain the basis of the legal argument that Microsoft could say the deal was in \"bad faith\"",

Who is providing the money for this company to run? The same people who will destroy the board..These clowns tried to destroy the company but instead they have destroyed their own careers.",

Whatever was going wrong, it had to be worth taking such a huge cut. The board isn't made up of idiots. Neither Altman nor the board are discussing what went wrong just yet. If Altman were unjustly fired, you could bet both he and Greg would be shouting it from the roof tops. Whatever it was, it was big.",
