    "How much does the 24 hour ceo replacement from twitch get in his parachute?..Honestly, whatever it is, he may have earned it. From a Bloomberg reporter: ..Emmett Shear joining the talks was a turning point in the negotiations. He asked the board to provide concrete evidence of Sam's wrongdoing. When they did not do so, he said he could not remain in the CEO role, and helped both sides find common ground to get Sam reinstated...That could easily just be PR spin on his part, but basically everyone is in a better position now than they were on Sunday. Sam is back at his company with proof of how essential he is. The threat of everyone leaving OpenAI is cleared off, so the old board now looks like massive idiots rather than the catastrophic failures who killed the golden goose. Microsoft's investment in AI stabilizes while keeping all the development risk out-of-house, plus they got in the good graces of OpenAI's head and could potentially get representation on the board. Shear probably gets a quick payday and some plaudits as a mediator CEO.",

Less than a week ago, OpenAI was the unstoppable flying unicorn of Silicon Valley that everyone wanted a piece of. Now, investors and businesses will view OpenAI with suspicion and will wait to see what happens before making any major moves or deals. In the long term, they may end up in a better place if they manage to implement a more effective governance structure and recruit some competent people for their board. We'll see...",
    "I don't know if the company itself is in a better position however...I set the comparison relative to Sunday and I'd argue the company's in a better position than they were then. OpenAI was legitimately looking at the prospect of the entire workforce leaving and going to Microsoft. They wouldn't be able to deliver products, which would collapse all their deals, and the company would just be an empty shell.  .Relative to last Thursday, yes, the company as a whole is in a worse position. The Friday night firing and the following day of \"wait, they did what and won't say why?\" news coverage absolutely battered the brand. It was on the brink.

    "Steve Jobs being fired didn't tarnish Apple's reputation",
    "If anything, Jobs being fired is an example of how disastrous it can be for a company if a successful CEO is fired..Jobs' firing didn't result in an immediate reputation problem, because Apple hired Pepsico exec John Sculley and was somehow able to spin that as a good thing. But within two years, Apple's reputation started to suffer. According to to The End of Innocence: What Happened After Apple Fired Steve Jobs:..\"When a company has as strong a brand and consumer franchise as Apple, it is very hard to destroy it,\" technology analyst Richard Shaffer told the New York Times. \"But it can be done.\u201d And from 1985 [two years after Sculley started] to 1997, it very nearly was...Sculley's replacement only lasted three years, and was fired with \"losses piling up and market share plummeting.\" And under the next CEO, Gil Amelio, \"Apple appeared to fall into a death spiral.\".It wasn't until Jobs was hired back via the acquisition of NeXT, and then reinstated as CEO, that the company started to recover. \"At this point, Apple was running on momentum alone; the idea that anyone could turn it around seemed almost absurd.\" But Jobs managed it..OpenAI managed to compress that process from the 14 years it took Apple, to a few days. Impressive stuff :D",
    "It absolutely did.  Nobody in computer tech innovation in the 80s/90s thought that was going to result in a more competitive Apple.  They were right.",
    "Btw I just wanted to mention /u/braclow's comments from the previous posts here since it's extremely important and may change the course of humanity (no exaggeration):.\u201cThe most important implication of this entire affair is that it may have changed the dynamics around safety and A.I. for a decade. While the board may have thought they were acting in the interests of safety, their reckless unplanned approach nearly set $80BLN of value and years of research on fire. All of Silicon Valley was just taught \u201cdon't give the safety people the reins\u201d. We are now likely in the accelerated timeline for artificial intelligence. Let's all hope for the best.\u201d",

We have seen no evidence that any company is working on anything that could even be classified in the realm of AGI let alone is AGI itself. I don't even think we understand what is necessary to develop something like that. It's just a theoretical concept. The stuff we are seeing like ChatGPT I hesitate to even call artificial intelligence but that has just become a catch all for anything that uses deep neural networks. .This type of stuff we are seeing is very advanced and very cool tech that still basically boils down to the most complex text auto complete in the world.

Although the accounts are unverifiable, there was clearly a lot of drama there..I expect the two most powerful players, Anthropic on its own and OpenAI/MSFT together to continue to focus heavily on safety, but I would be concerned about the other players/challengers that have everything to lose because they don't have eye-catching LLM's of their own yet",

You are responsible for both selling and defending your moral position and for missteps as it all unfolds..Nonprofit as it may be, you can't have the board stating that if it comes to it, they'll destroy the company. Yes things like AGI are the things of potential nightmares, but you can't mix theory/doomsday predictions with an attempt at day-to-day business. This is a capitalist society where too much adherence to philosophy will ensure that you go broke, where you are expected to go out there and try, even if you scrape your knees, where you go all in and go broke trying..The second you admit you aren't willing to go all in / won't go for broke is the second before somebody eats your lunch..Some folks just made safety that much harder, but this situation made safety that much more important. Folks with such convictions, and I would personally hope most of us, must continue forward with safety top of mind.

And I'm more inclined to think that the board here is in the wrong. What's more likely, that a board of 4 wealthy powerful people are acting in their own interests rather than humanities, or 5 heads of departments, a co founder, and 700 employees who all resigned in protest or are threatening to leave are all morally corrupt and were willing to follow Altman into a future Skynet? That level of solidarity speaks volumes. I'm more inclined to believe the little guys when they band together like this than the board members..I think a lot of the people defending the boards actions bought the \"ethics\" excuse hook line and sinker without thinking about the wider context. Tech workers are generally very politically progressive. The fact that so many low level employees want Altman back I think speaks volumes, but people who are scared of AI have been conned into believing Altman is a danger because the Board said he is, dismissing all the votes of confidence he's received from the actual little people doing the work who support his return.",

It's a \"Choose Your Own Conspiracy\", with two tangible things:  .1) The board hasn't released any statements as to their reasoning..2) The former board's chosen temp CEO, Emmett Shear, has.  He confirmed that it wasn't about safety at all.",
    "Not to mention one of the outcome of their negotiation is to have a 3rd party independent investigation into what happened. Somehow even the people involved don't have the full story.",
    "Agreed--what I said about the safety is entirely speculation based on rumors from employees and \"insiders\". We never got a clear explanation from the people who did it that I've seen. I think it makes the most sense, though. The timing after the conference where he talked about commercialization--the fact that the non-profit board is built with AGI doomers..That said, the tomfoolery of the last few days does make me question the board's motivations. Maybe it had nothing to do with safety and instead to do with immature power dynamics..I apologize for wording my comment so authoritatively.",
    "I don't think it was entirely gross incompetence. What they didn't account for was the cult that Altman has cultivated amongst the workforce. So many of them threatened to walk (as in, almost everybody) that it is unreal. Real \u201cdrink this punch, put on some Nikes, and lie down in bed with a bag on your head to board the mothership\u201d levels of dedication. .To a singular man.",
    "That seems to be the tech sector - blinded by hubris.",
    "Hubris plus the OpenAI employees were going to make a ton of money based on OpenAIs future financial performance. 99% of the organization is all motivated by financial growth. It's no wonder something like this happened.",
    "I don't think it was entirely gross incompetence. What they didn't account for was the cult that Altman has cultivated amongst the workforce...This is a bad take. The whole purpose of creating OpenAI LLC (the for-profit arm) was because they couldn't hire enough good AI researchers for the salaries offered by the nonprofit). The LLC enabled them to claim \u201c7 figure\u201d total comp packages, but they were heavilly propped up by \u201cfunny money\u201d (equity/profit participation units). .The reason all the employeesbacked the CEO is that the board completely blew up and zeroed out the PPUs with their little stunt. Microsoft and several other companies that were preparing to imminently dump more money into OAI (and thus turn the funny money into real money) did an immediate 180. .So, a bunch of people with the prospect of buying a nice house in Palo Alto in a few months suddenly had that dream (and several years of hard work) snatched away. You should be 0% surprised that they would be mad at the board for that.",
    "If 20% of employees walk, you could assume it's just loyalty to Altman. If 80% of employees walk, there's probably something else on their mind.",
    "It WAS gross incompetence. If the goal was to get rid of him, they should have consulted or at least warned Microsoft, and they would have parted in \"good\" public terms (aka after compensation negociations) instead of firing him overnight without notice. This is Trump level of incompetence.",
    "Yes, these are totally serious people that we can trust with potentially destructive technology.",
    "Literal r/subredditdrama type behavior at one of the most important companies on the planet right now. We are so doomed lol.",
    "This reminds me the failed Wagner coup. I did not expected it would happen, it went in totally different direction i assumed it would go and it ended way faster than i could comprehend.",
    "And the board finally capitulated. It was only a matter of time,  and the longer they waited the more damage to the company. But boy had this been a wild week",
    "Probably really good time to look at a certain board member who started a company using OpenAI's api. A meager existence which got completely wiped out due a certain recent few of openAI's most recent announcements doing basically what they did on top of the api, but natively and better. .Hmmmmm, totally doesnt sound like some sort of conflict of interest nor a suspicious event at all when it happened in the weeks leading up to this all. Its totally not like this was just a reaction over one the board members being embarrassed and losing money.",
    "I just feel bad for the in-house counsel and HR people that had days of fire drills creating board materials, re-drafting corp governance docs, termination letters, all to have to do the opposite a few days later.",
    "Sorry about the paywall! Didn't realize that NYT puts one up when referrer is Reddit.Tl;dr is Sam Altman is returning with two new board members: Larry Summers and Bret Taylor. Ilya Sutskever and Tasha McCauley are out. Adam D'Angelo, CEO of Quora, remains the only ouster on the board.",
    "Background on the two board members who were replaced....McCauley, 42, is known partly as an engineer and entrepreneur, but also as the wife of American actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt. She studied electrical engineering at Stanford University and earned a master's degree in robotics from Carnegie Mellon. Co-founder of Fellow Robots, she ran GeoSim Systems, a company that develops software for the robotics sector, and this year joined Rand Corporation, an analysis and consulting firm focused on public policy. She met Gordon-Levitt in 2009 and they married in 2014. They have two children..McCauley sits on the advisory board of the Center for the Governance of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Oxford, as does the third independent director, Helen Toner. McCauley is also linked to the effective altruism movement, with a utilitarian and philanthropic orientation. Specifically, it is part of the British branch of Effective Ventures, parent company of the Center for Effective Altruism. Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of the cryptocurrency platform FTX who was recently found guilty of several crimes, also belonged to that movement...You can read more about effective altruism here (without paywall)",

    "So is this season 2 or 3 of Suits?.I've traditionally not had a lot of interest in the day to day politics or boardroom discussions of large companies, but that has changed, and I'd be up for cameras in the offices, hallways, break room, IT room and bathrooms (mirrors and sinks only, of course) of OpenAI, and maybe a small team to edit it all into an interesting drama at the end of each day..Otherwise, I'm glad he's back. For better or worse, I was actually starting to have feelings about what was going to happen to my ChatGPT assistant, friend and sometimes counsellor..Interested in seeing what follows this shakeup/re-shaping\u2026",
    "Absolutely wild ride. The net effect is OpenAI has lost a ton of brand trust. The board needs to go.",
    "Ideally I think the net effect is a slightly larger circle of people coming to the realization that the Silicon Valley brain-trust can't find their ass with both hands when it comes to formulating technocratic solutions to societal issues.",
    "I find it crazy that people are cheering this guy on and painting the board that kicked him out as the bad guys, even though, supposedly, they were the ones trying to slow down commercialization due to ethics concerns... That's some impressive spin doctor-ing to make him out like the good guy, if it's true.",
    "OpenAI's revamped board of directors will include Bret Taylor, an early Facebook officer and former co-chief executive of Salesforce.Oh good a Facebook alum in there now. /s..This is the guy that helped the sale of Twitter to Elon....Everyone got played and they proved most people are sukas..We got a Paypal Mafia and Facebook board now, and Satya looking really naive..I distrusted OpenAI/ChatGPT before, but now even more. Now they are embedded in Windows/Office365 and people somehow were fighting for a VC/PE foreign funded Thiel frontman? So easily played. All this was a power play and people fell for it like a reality TV president, this is Trump/Elon level bullshit..Opinion of OpenAI is lower now and opinion of Microsoft being a leveraged capitulating appeasing biiatch on this has fallen even farther. What a clusterfuck of power plays and dipshits not getting what is going on..Are we gonna have to see Altmans face like Trump/Elon/Zucc/etc all the time now?.This is a Ballmer moment for Satya Nadella.",
    "The danger to ai is not skynet, it's massive unemployment for folks. That would be hard for governments to keep a handle on. Good ai, ups unemployment massively.",
    "There are many many many dangers with AI, but today the dollar won out.  When I watched Sam on a podcast earlier this year he was very handwavey about several safety issues, and I get the impression that he and others have a mentality that they're willing to risk the obliteration of humanity for a chance to become the richest and most influential people on the planet.  .Seems like a gamble not worth taking, but in a hyper capitalist society it's no surprise people are still trying to become Kings..While there was certainly a sea blunders in this saga, I just hope that the board maintains the goal of \"good of all humanity\" but it doesn't look like the people coming in are going to respect that.",

    "Hmm I think this is different. Before it was doing it differently with better tech, but I'm a white collar guy making 6 figures and I can use it to rapidly decrease the amount of time it takes to hit deliverables. I am a single man dependency so I don't have a lot of fear, but a lot of other jobs will go from needing 5 analyst to 2. Going to put a lot of downward pressure on salaries and give more leverage to companies. That's going to fk the economy.",

    "Sam and Microsoft's power play worked or Ilya and Tasha's failed miserably. Either way Ilya and Tasha are gone now. Would not be surprised if the new non-profit board members are Microsoft stooges. And with Sam to break any ties in Microsoft's favour they don't even need to directly take over. They now own the board. The board owns the non-profit. The non-profit owns the IP, models, and research, which is what Microsoft ultimately wants..It's anti-trust lawsuit Microsoft all over again. Embrace (invest in OpenAI and help fund their operations), extend (offer ChatGPT services in all their products, some for free), extinguish (steer OpenAI towards being aligned with their goals then dump them eventually). It's wild getting to watch it play out again in real time in our hyper connected world.",
    "[only speaking for myself].Ilya seems like he's still there but no longer on the board. Obviously this just happened a few hours ago so I'm not sure if anything will change..If there was a Sam/MSFT PowerPlay, it was clearly in response - not to initiate this whole thing..MSFT already has access to everything. That said, I would not appreciate \u201cstooges\u201d on the board. There was a good working relationship before, and it was productive and profitable for everybody, or at least, it seemed that way before this drama came out..Folks really don't wanna let \u201cEEE\u201d go do they. If you're not gonna let go now, you're not gonna let go ever",

    "I, representing my people, agree with you",
    "Who will trust OpenAI now? And they added Larry Summers to the board? Larry is not even an engineer or a scientist!.Was this nonsense done so that Sam can get majority shares in OpenAI?.Was it to change OpenAI charter from non for profit to for profit?",
    "No one should trust any AI company. The technology needs to be heavily regulated to minimize abuse..Altman's approach of doing that by commercialization only means that the rich and corporate will have all the power to generate money while the peasants feed their information and data for free..I don't know why everyone is fawning over that corporate sack of shit lol.",
